httpOnly cookies instead of localStorage (more secure against XSS). This requires the backend to set a cookie and the frontend to send requests with credentials: 'include'.

Refresh tokens to avoid forcing re-login when access tokens expire.

Persistent DB: swap users array for SQLite/Postgres/Mongo.

Rate-limiting & brute-force protection: e.g., express-rate-limit.

CSRF protection if you use cookies.

Use HTTPS, environment JWT_SECRET, and strong validation.
